Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.","awards":"Top rated movie #13 | Won 4 Oscars, 157 wins & 220 nominations total","genres":"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi","companyList":[{"id":"co0147954","name":"Syncopy"},{"id":"co0002663","name":"Warner Bros."},{"id":"co0159111","name":"Legendary Entertainment"}],"countries":"USA, UK","languages":"English, Japanese, French","contentRating":"PG-13","imDbRating":8.8,"boxOffice":{"id":null,"budget":"$160,000,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"$62,785,337","grossUSA":"$292,587,330","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$836,848,102"},"tagline":"Your mind is the scene of the crime","keywordList":["ambiguous ending","dream","surprise ending","mindbender","subconscious"],"similars":[{"id":"tt0816692","title":"Interstellar"},{"id":"tt0468569","title":"The Dark Knight"},{"id":"tt0111161","title":"The Shawshank Redemption"},{"id":"tt0133093","title":"The Matrix"},{"id":"tt0114369","title":"Se7en"},{"id":"tt0137523","title":"Fight Club"},{"id":"tt0109830","title":"Forrest Gump"},{"id":"tt0110912","title":"Pulp Fiction"},{"id":"tt7286456","title":"Joker"},{"id":"tt1345836","title":"The Dark Knight Rises"},{"id":"tt0167260","title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"},{"id":"tt0993846","title":"The Wolf of Wall Street"}],"starList":[{"id":"nm0330687","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","image":null,"asCharacter":null},{"id":"nm0000138","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","image":null,"asCharacter":null},{"id":"nm0680983","name":"Elliot Page","image":null,"asCharacter":null}]}
