What begins as an open-and-shut case of murder soon becomes a detective story that presents a succession of clues creating doubt, and a mini-drama of each of the jurors' prejudices and preconceptions about the trial, the accused, AND each other. Based on the play, all of the action takes place on the stage of the jury room.","awards":"Top rated movie #5 | Nominated for 3 Oscars, 17 wins & 13 nominations total","genres":"Crime, Drama","companyList":[{"id":"co0032902","name":"Orion-Nova Productions"}],"countries":"USA","languages":"English","contentRating":"Approved","imDbRating":9.0,"boxOffice":{"id":null,"budget":"$350,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$955"},"tagline":"Life Is In Their Hands -- Death Is On Their Minds!","keywordList":["jury room","jury","courtroom","dialogue driven","trial"],"similars":[{"id":"tt0108052","title":"Schindler's List"},{"id":"tt0102926","title":"The Silence of the Lambs"},{"id":"tt0111161","title":"The Shawshank Redemption"},{"id":"tt0099685","title":"Goodfellas"},{"id":"tt0071562","title":"The Godfather: Part II"},{"id":"tt0110912","title":"Pulp Fiction"},{"id":"tt0073486","title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"},{"id":"tt0109830","title":"Forrest Gump"},{"id":"tt0068646","title":"The Godfather"},{"id":"tt0137523","title":"Fight Club"},{"id":"tt0060196","title":"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"},{"id":"tt0167260","title":"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"}],"starList":[{"id":"nm0002011","name":"Lee J.
